    "### ✅ ANSWER: **NO**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum teleportation does NOT allow faster-than-light (FTL) communication.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Classical Channel Required:**  \n",
    "Alice must send **2 classical bits** via normal channel (phone, radio, etc.). This is **limited by speed of light c**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Bob Can't Use State Without Classical Info:**  \n",
    "Even though quantum state changes instantly on Bob's side, Bob doesn't know which **corrections** to apply until classical message arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Measurement Outcomes Are Random:**  \n",
    "Alice's measurements give **random** results. Bob sees only randomness until he knows Alice's results → no information extracted FTL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. No Causality Violation:**  \n",
    "- Entanglement correlation ≠ information transfer\n",
    "- Information transfer requires classical communication\n",
    "- Classical communication ≤ c\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timeline:**\n",
    "- t=0: Alice measures (instant quantum correlation)\n",
    "- t=d/c: Classical bits arrive at Bob\n",
    "- t>d/c: Bob applies corrections and can use state\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom line:**  \n",
    "Teleportation limited by **classical communication speed**, preserving special relativity!\n",

    "- Penalty: Says YES\n",

    "### ✅ ANSWER: **2 classical bits**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Protocol:**\n",

    "2. Each outcome tells Bob which corrections:\n",
    "   - 00 → No operation (I)\n",
